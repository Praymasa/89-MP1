                Family life is changing, and so, too, is the role mothers and fathers play at work and at home. As more mothers have entered the U.S. workforce in the past several decades, the share of two-parent households in which both parents work full time now stands at 46%, up from 31% in 1970. At the same time, the share with a father who works full time and a mother who doesnâ€™t work outside the home has declined considerably; 26% of two-parent households today fit this description, compared with 46% in 1970, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of Current Population Survey data.

                There are several advantages and disadvantages to having both parents in the workforce. The obvious advantage would be that the household income would double if both parents work. My father often tells me that we children are very fortunate. During his school days, he did not have the luxury of owning expensive toys. There were no such luxuries like engaging a private tutor to help them in their schoolwork. With both my parents working, they can afford to give us the very best. They can buy us more assessment books, employ a private tutor to help us revise our schoolwork as well as send us for music lessons. We can even afford to upgrade our housing from a flat to a private condominium and go for vacations in exotic places.

                The children of two working parents tend to develop independence at a young age. They have to do everything myself. They have to see their own meals, wash their own clothes and do their schoolwork without having a parent's guidance. This works well only in cases where the children are sensible enough to tell right from wrong.
            </p>

            <p>
                In some cases, the opposite often happens. The children may not do their homework without their mother to guide them. They may waste their time talking over the telephone, watching television or playing all the time. In extreme cases, they would spend their spare time shopping, going to the cinema or hanging around in public places. Some get involved with bad company and pick up habits such as smoking and gambling. I believe that parents should exercise their judgement, as they know their children best. If their children are those who lack discipline, then it is best for the mother to stay home and be responsible for the upbringing of the children, at least until the latter are better able to take care of themselves.

            <p>
                Some working parents leave their children to the care of their maids. However, one cannot expect the maids to impart family values or instil discipline in such children. It has to be the responsibility of the parents. With two working parents, the time spent with their children is definitely compromised. They only have time to attend to their children at night or during the weekends. By then, they are sometimes so exhausted that they need time-out themselves. In some case, parents may even need to work overtime and sacrifice whatever little time they have with their children. The children may feel neglected and lost and this may have a negative impact or influence on them. In such instances, family ties will be weakened. Family problems will arise.
